GANDHINAGAR: Widely seen as the BJP's prime ministerial candidate, Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi declared on Thursday that he wants to "serve" Gujarat until 2017.

Re-elected the chief minister in 2012 for five years, Modi, 62, told a group of school students here on Teacher's Day in response to a question: "I will serve my people till 2017."

He said in life "one should always dream of doing something".

Modi was made this year the Bharatiya Janata Party's Lok Sabha campaign chief, further fuelling speculation that he is in the race for the Prime Minister's post.
