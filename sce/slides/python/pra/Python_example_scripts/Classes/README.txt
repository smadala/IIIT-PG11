CLASSES vs MODULES

	* Both are namespaces
	* Both are used to package data/logic 

Differences between modules and classes:

Modules:

	- Created by writing Python files (.py)
	- Import them to use them 
 	- Only one instance of a module in memory. 
	
Classes:
	
	- Create new objects (are factories of new objects)
	- Call them to use them 
	- Always live within a module 
	- We can make as many instances as we need


Moreover, classes support extra features modules don't. 

	e.g. Inhertitance, multiple instance generation, operator overloading
